# This script will:

# 1. create a dependency graph of feedstocks
# 2. update version numbers in the dependency graph
# 3. create migrations, but not run them
# 4. run migrations and submit pull requests on GitHub for the nsls-ii-forge
# 5. display the status of migrations/pull requests

# This will use ~/.conda-smithy authentication for GitHub token
# It will use nsls2forge username on GitHub
# It will not fork repositories but instead create new branches
# It will use a max of 10 workers to build the graph

# If something goes wrong while executing this script
# please use 'auto-tick clean', fix the issue, and try again

# will stop execution if error occurs
set -e

# remove this (TEST ONLY)
